<p>
  servers works!
  generated by the command line
  ng generate component servers
  This displays data from the typescript.

  Also can use Event Binding to send data from HTML to the TypeScript code.
</p>
<!-- this is Property Binding, can tell by the HTML property in []. -->
<button class="btn btn-primary"
        [disabled]="!allowNewServer"
        (click)="onCreateServer()">After two secons enabled...Add Server
</button>
<p> Output for Event Binding => {{ serverCreationStatus }}</p>
<p>This is String Interpolation: {{ allowNewServer }}</p>
<app-server></app-server>
<app-server></app-server>
